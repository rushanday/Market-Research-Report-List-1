<p><strong>The Spine Augmentation Systems Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Percutaneous Kyphoplasty</li><li>Percutaneous Vertebroplasty</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Spine Augmentation Systems market encompasses applications for minimally invasive procedures such as percutaneous kyphoplasty and percutaneous vertebroplasty. Both techniques are designed to treat vertebral compression fractures caused by osteoporosis, trauma, or tumor effects. Percutaneous kyphoplasty involves inflating a balloon to restore vertebral height before stabilizing it with cement, while vertebroplasty directly injects cement into the fractured vertebra. These procedures aim to alleviate pain, enhance mobility, and improve quality of life, making them vital in orthopedic and neurosurgical practices.</p></p>
