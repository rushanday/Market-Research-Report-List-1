<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Subsea Blowout Preventer (BOP) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Annular Blowout Preventer</li><li>Ram Blowout Preventer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The subsea blowout preventer (BOP) market includes two primary types: annular and ram blowout preventers. Annular BOPs utilize a flexible rubber sealing element to seal around the drill pipe, accommodating varying sizes and ensuring effective control over well pressure. In contrast, ram BOPs employ mechanical devices, or rams, to seal the wellbore by closing around the pipe or completely sealing off the well. Both types are crucial for preventing blowouts during drilling operations, ensuring safety and environmental protection.</p></p>
